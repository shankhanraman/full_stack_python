# Full Stack Python ‚Äì Chai aur Code Edition

This is my repo while learning **Full Stack Python** through Hitesh Choudhary‚Äôs *Chai aur Code* course.
It‚Äôs less of a polished project and more of a diary of code, experiments, and the occasional bug that refuses to leave.

---

## What this course covers

* Python üêç (obviously, the star of the show)
* Understanding the core of Large Language Models (LLMs): tokenization, embeddings, attention, and transformers
* Running and deploying models locally with Ollama, Hugging Face, and Docker
* Creating stateful AI systems with LangGraph (nodes, edges, checkpointing)
* Deployment and the art of breaking production at midnight

---

## My learning notes

* `pip install` is basically life support
* Most bugs aren‚Äôt errors, they‚Äôre personality tests
* Git commit messages are usually confessions like:

  ```
  fixed the thing that broke the other thing
  ```
* ‚ÄúSun lo dhyaan se‚Äù from Hitesh is usually followed by something important I miss the first time

---

## The course mantra

Chai in one hand, code in the other. If the code doesn‚Äôt work, maybe it‚Äôs time for another cup.

---

## What I hope to get by the end

* Projects that actually run
* A better understanding of how the web holds itself together
* The confidence to call myself a full stack Python developer (with Stack Overflow open in another tab)
